# NameReactionMaster

The Name Reaction Master app is a tool to help you learn name reactions in organic chemistry. 

###It provides: 
1. a list of 230+ name reactions. 
2. a summary of reaction type categories.
3. a test in which a reaction scheme will be randomly displayed, and the reaction name needs to be chosen from 4 options. 

###Specific features: 
In this app, a large numbers of reactions have been categorized into reaction types such as oxidation or cross coupling, so it will be really easy to check one specific type of reactions as well as simply compare reactions within that type. In addition, we believe that one difficult part in memorizing name reactions is the connection between a reaction and its name. The test section of this app not only offers a training of this connection, but also allows you to apply repetition in memorization in a quick and simple way.
